# Overview
 Island Hunter is an open-world first-person shooter game where the player's objective is to eliminate anomalous creatures that were discovered on the island after a meteor strike. The local wildlife has mutated due to a virus contained within the meteor, and it's the player's responsibility to rid the island of these creatures. The game features large boss fights and allows the player to freely explore the open-world map.

# Reflection
This project suffered from lack of focus. Each team member wanted different features, so the games lack strong core. It would be better to focus on one bossfight but implement interesting mechanics to accompany it.
